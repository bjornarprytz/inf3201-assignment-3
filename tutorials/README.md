### Multithreading

The course assumes that you know some of the basics of multithreaded programming. This includes things like:

- creating and terminating a thread
- synchronizing with a terminating thread (pthrad_join)
- thread synchronization (mutexes, monitors and condition variables)
- some of the implications of the shared address space and synchronization
  - race conditions
  - deadlocks
  - livelocks 

Some of this will be touched upon in the lectures, but mainly to brush up on it before we dive deeper into some aspect of it. The assumed background level for this is roughly similar to working knowledge from taking an Operating Systems course.

We will mainly use Linux in the course, so you should look into tutorials for writing multithreaded programs on Linux.
