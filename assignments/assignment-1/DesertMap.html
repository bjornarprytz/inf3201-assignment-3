  <h1>Assignment 1: Desert Map</h2>


  <h3>Story</h3>

  <p>Wile E. Coyote must catch that road-runner, the RoadRunner is
  the only eatable thing in the desert, it is that simple! We all know
  that a large variety of ACME equipment has previously failed Wile so
  now he need a new approach.</p>

  <p>The first thing Wile must have to stand a chance to catch the
  RoadRunner is information on the desert, precise information, e.g. a
  map that may zoom into any required detail. Fortunately this
  particular desert may be described by a very simple mathematical
  function, also known as the Mandelbrot set. Unfortunately
  calculating the map is a large computing problem, and since we
  cannot apply any mechanical zoom techniques, we must generate a new
  image for each zoom factor of the desired map. Thus to get his
  information fast enough Wile need a fast mechanism for generating a
  map. To this end we need a map generator that can utilize more than
  one CPU.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The map of the desert, first the initial map and then the final
    zoom</p>
  </div>


  <h3>Assignment</h3>

  <p>Write two parallel versions of the map generation code, you may
  use the sequential version below as a core. Both parallel versions
  should be based on message passing using MPI, and execute on a
  cluster. One version should use a fixed orchestration approach,
  where orchestration can be defined either at compile-time or
  initially at run-time. The other solution should be based on a
  producer-consumer approach, which should define the number of
  workers either at compile-time or run-time.</p>

  <p>A written report accompanying the code, should identify the
  various choices that have been made as well as individual techniques
  that have been applied to improve performance. And the impact of each
  should be documented.</p>


  <h3>Optimization</h3>

  <p>Any optimization technique may be employed to increase the speed, 
  except shared-memory techniques (i.e. no multithreading). This includes
  changes to the algorithm, data structure optimizations and vector instructions.</p>


  <h4>Hand-in</h4>
  
  	<p>Use the same structure as in the code directory. Include your report as a PDF document in the root directory.
	   Compress the directory as a tar.gz or zip file, and upload it to Fronter.</p>

    <p>The deadline is Thursday, September 17th, 24:00. Do <em>not</em> miss the
    deadline.</p>
